/*
 * T14 — Claims-mapping projector.
 *
 * Pure deterministic translation from a Fief user-claims bag to Saleor's split
 * metadata buckets. The Fief→Saleor sync handlers (T22-T29) and the
 * reconciliation job (T30-T32) call this once per user and compare the output
 * to what's already stored in Saleor; only deltas are written.
 *
 * Saleor terminology (which this module follows):
 *   - `metadata`        — public, returned from the storefront API.
 *   - `privateMetadata` — server-only, gated behind the `MANAGE_USERS` perm.
 *
 * Per PRD §F3.3 (and the T43 ADR), removing a mapping does NOT delete
 * previously-written Saleor metadata. The projector implements this by
 * simply omitting absent claims from the output — the caller never receives
 * a delete instruction, so previously-written values stay in place.
 *
 * The function is pure (no I/O, no global state) and deterministic: the same
 * `(mapping, claims)` input always produces the same output, regardless of
 * insertion order of object keys in the claims bag. This is necessary because
 * the diff-against-Saleor optimization in the sync handlers depends on stable
 * string equality between projector runs.
 */

/*
 * The shape of a single mapping entry as consumed by the projector.
 *
 * As of T17, T8's `ClaimMappingEntry` carries a superset of the projector's
 * input fields (`{ fiefClaim, saleorMetadataKey, required, visibility,
 * reverseSyncEnabled }`). The projector only needs the `visibility`-routed
 * subset, so we keep this `interface` as a structural Pick to avoid a hard
 * dependency from T14 onto T8's schema module — call sites can pass either
 * shape because TypeScript structural typing matches on field overlap.
 *
 * Tests still use `ClaimMappingProjectionEntry` directly to keep the test
 * surface focused on what the projector actually reads.

 * Project a Fief claims bag into the Saleor metadata buckets per the supplied

 *
 * Skipped (i.e. NOT written to either bucket):
 *   - Claim is absent from `fiefUserClaims` (`undefined`).
 *   - Claim value is `null`. We treat `null` as "no value" rather than
 *     serializing the literal string "null" — operators expressed surprise
 *     in the PRD review when JSON `null` round-tripped to a metadata cell.
 *
 * Stringification:
 *   - Primitives (`string` | `number` | `boolean` | `bigint`): `String(v)`.
 *     Numbers print in their decimal form; booleans as "true" / "false".
 *   - `undefined` and `null`: skipped (see above).
 *   - Objects/arrays: stable JSON. Object keys are sorted lexicographically
 *     at every nesting level; array order is preserved. The result is byte-
 *     stable across runs regardless of original key insertion order, which
 *     is what makes the diff-against-Saleor optimization possible.
